`Field` connects its label and help/error message to `Input`, `Textarea`, `TagsInput`, and `SelectTrigger`. It also shares required and invalid state. Set `htmlFor` when you give the control an explicit `id`; otherwise the field generates an ID.

Validation belongs to your form. Derive `error` from the current value and pass `undefined` when valid, as in the live example. A static error string stays visible until your form clears it. Set `required` on the `Select` root as well for native form validation. For a custom control, use `useFieldControl` to connect the same attributes.
