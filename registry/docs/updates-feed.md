`UpdatesFeed` props: `days` (`{ date, dateTime?, entries }[]`); each entry is `{ tag, tone?, title?, body?, items?,
media? }`. `tag` is any word; Added, New, Improved, Changed, Fixed and Removed pick their color, `tone` (`blue` | `ink`
| `danger`) overrides it. `media` is framed with a hairline; an iframe keeps 16:9.

`UpdateTag` is exported for a tag on its own.
